# Sheltr

Over the years, the process a homeless person has to go through to find, locate, and check into a homeless shelter has not necessarily gotten more difficult, but it definitely hasn't gotten any easier. Even after a homeless person goes through that process and fills out a shelter intake form, there is no guarantee that they have a spot at a shelter to sleep at night. Even if they do find a shelter to stay at, they have to repeat that process over and over, night after night.

This complex process has led to a rise in people sleeping on the streets, a rise in homeless camps along Minneapolis highways, and people dying from being denied a warm place to sleep at night. One of the fastest growing homeless demographic is youth. Many youth are turning to the streets for a variety of reasons and even using the light rail service in Minneapolis at night to keep warm.

This project hopes to solve and slow down the rapidly growing homeless crisis in Minneapolis. The project is a mobile and web based app intended for homeless people to use and intended to help streamline the process of checking into the shelter. The short term goal of this app is to get homeless people into a shelter easily and quickly each night. The long term goal of this app is to provide an opportunity for homeless people to rebuild their lives and get off the streets for good.
